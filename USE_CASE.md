# AppDynamics ActiveMQ Monitoring Extension

ActiveMQ is an open source, JMS 1.1 compliant, message-oriented middleware (MOM) from the Apache Software Foundation that provides high-availability, performance, scalability, reliability and security for enterprise messaging.
The ActiveMQ Monitoring extension collects metrics from an ActiveMQ messaging server and uploads them to the AppDynamics Metric Browser.
